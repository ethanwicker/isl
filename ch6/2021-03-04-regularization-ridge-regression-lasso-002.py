# This blog has a great example of making the plot:
# https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-regression-for-better-usage-2f19b3a202db
# show the comparison to statsmodels https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.fit_regularized.html

# Boston housing data
# Grid search example of best C value for ridge
# then evaludate model via cross-validation with that C on all data
# Show the plot

# Repeat for lasso
# Maybe show the plot

# Show either or in statsmodels, and comment that the other is just changing one value
